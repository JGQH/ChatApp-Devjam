## Introduction
This project is a project from [app-ideas](https://github.com/rickywid/app-ideas).

It aims to create a chat app where users can interact with each other in realtime by sending messages. In this case, all the information is managed by the users (And a relay server) via Descentralized Graph DB managed using GUN.
